% This code performs multiple linear regression analysis on a set of basin
% characteristics pulled from an excel file called
% USGS_merged_flow_trimmed.xlsx in the same folder as this m-file
% (S:\shared\GOA_Runoff\Streamflow\Analysis\USGS).
% 
% The difference between this code and previous attempts at multiple linear
% regression is that this considers power law:
% 
%          Q = A*(x1^a1)*(x2^a2)*...
%   log10(Q) = log10(A) + a1*log10(x1) + a2*log10(x2) + ...

%see things like stepwiselm, fitlm, and so on. Huge, huge topic in Matlab!

%Also be aware that regress will spit out all sorts of performance
%statistics that are important to understand.
